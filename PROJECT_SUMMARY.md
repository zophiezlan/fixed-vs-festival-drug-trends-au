# Project Summary: Australian Drug Checking Mixed-Methods Analysis

## What Was Built

A complete **mixed-methods data analysis project** demonstrating how **fixed-site drug checking services** detect higher drug diversity and serve as early warning systems for Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS), validated through both quantitative analysis and qualitative stakeholder interviews.

## Key Components

### 1. Quantitative Data Generation (`src/generate_data.py`)
- Generates realistic synthetic datasets
- 500 fixed-site samples + 400 festival samples
- Includes substance types, NPS flags, adulterants
- Reflects real-world detection rate differences

### 2. Qualitative Data Generation (`src/generate_qualitative_data.py`)
- Generates synthetic stakeholder interview data
- 9 service provider interviews (5 fixed-site, 4 festival)
- 15 service user interviews (8 fixed-site, 7 festival)
- Covers key themes: detection capabilities, early warning, user populations, harm reduction impact

### 3. Quantitative Analysis Engine (`src/analysis.py`)
- **DrugCheckingAnalyzer** class with comprehensive methods:
  - Service comparison metrics
  - Shannon & Simpson diversity indices
  - NPS detection rate tracking
  - Early warning system analysis
  - Temporal trend analysis
  - Adulterant detection comparison

### 4. Qualitative Analysis Module (`src/qualitative_analysis.py`)
- **QualitativeAnalyzer** class for interview analysis:
  - Thematic analysis across stakeholder groups
  - Participant characteristic summaries
  - Theme extraction and comparison
  - Key difference identification

### 5. Mixed-Methods Integration (`src/mixed_methods.py`)
- **MixedMethodsIntegrator** combines both data types:
  - Convergent findings identification
  - Complementary insights synthesis
  - Triangulation analysis
  - Integrated interpretation

### 6. Visualization Suite (`src/visualization.py`)
- **DrugCheckingVisualizer** creates 5 publication-ready charts:
  1. Service Comparison (4-panel overview)
  2. NPS Trends (temporal analysis)
  3. Substance Distribution (top substances)
  4. NPS Diversity (detailed NPS comparison)
  5. Early Warning System (detection timing)

### 7. Main Pipeline (`main.py`)
- Single-command execution of mixed-methods analysis
- Generates data → Analyzes (quant & qual) → Integrates → Visualizes → Reports
- Clear console output with progress tracking

### 8. Testing Suite (`test_pipeline.py`)
- 6 comprehensive tests
- Validates quantitative data generation and analysis
- Tests qualitative data generation and analysis
- Verifies mixed-methods integration
- Confirms full pipeline execution

## Key Findings (Mixed-Methods Synthesis)

### Quantitative Findings

#### Drug Diversity
- **Fixed-site**: 38 unique substances
- **Festival**: 22 unique substances
- **Difference**: +73% more diversity at fixed sites

#### NPS Detection
- **Fixed-site**: 42.8% detection rate (24 unique NPS types)
- **Festival**: 23.2% detection rate (8 unique NPS types)
- **Difference**: +84% higher NPS rate, 3x more NPS types

#### Diversity Indices
- **Fixed-site Shannon Index**: 3.509
- **Festival Shannon Index**: 2.914
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate greater diversity

#### Early Warning Function
- **Fixed-site detected first**: 17 substances
- **Festival detected first**: 5 substances
- **Ratio**: 3.4:1 advantage for fixed sites

#### Adulterant Detection
- **Fixed-site**: 38.0% of samples
- **Festival**: 13.5% of samples
- **Difference**: 2.8x better detection at fixed sites

### Qualitative Findings

#### Service Provider Perspectives
- **Detection capabilities**: Fixed-site providers emphasize sophisticated equipment and longer analysis time
- **Early warning**: Year-round operation cited as key advantage for trend identification
- **User populations**: Different service models attract distinct clientele with varying needs
- **Resource needs**: Both models require sustained support; serve complementary functions

#### Service User Perspectives
- **Access preferences**: Fixed-site users value privacy and thoroughness; festival users prioritize convenience
- **Trust factors**: Different aspects valued - clinical setting vs. peer-based approach
- **Information needs**: Fixed-site users seek comprehensive analysis; festival users want quick confirmation
- **Behavior change**: Fixed-site testing associated with more sustained behavior modification

### Integrated Mixed-Methods Findings

#### Strong Convergence Points
1. **Superior Detection at Fixed Sites**: Quantitative 73% advantage explained by equipment, time, and diverse samples (qualitative)
2. **Early Warning Advantage**: 3.4:1 quantitative advantage supported by provider reports of year-round operation benefits
3. **Service Complementarity**: Both data types emphasize distinct but essential roles for each model
4. **User Population Differences**: Quantitative substance patterns align with qualitative reports of different user needs

#### Complementary Insights
- **Service Efficiency**: Quantitative shows higher cost per sample; qualitative reveals system-level value
- **User Satisfaction**: Not captured quantitatively; qualitative fills gap in understanding service value
- **Mechanisms**: Qualitative explains why quantitative patterns exist
